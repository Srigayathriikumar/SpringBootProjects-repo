#  Issue Tracker ORM

A simple issue tracking system built with **Spring Boot**, using **Spring Data JPA** and a **PostgreSQL** database. The application allows users to manage projects, assign users, and track bugs in a structured and scalable way.

---

## Introduction

This project is designed to demonstrate a clean and modular approach to building a RESTful backend using Java Spring Boot and ORM (Hibernate JPA). The system supports:

- Creating and managing **users**
- Managing **projects**
- Tracking **bugs** associated with projects

---

##  Description

This backend application supports the following:

- Managing Users with roles (e.g., Manager, Developer)
- Managing Projects with project names and associated bugs
- Reporting and retrieving Bugs tied to specific projects

Data is persisted using **PostgreSQL** and accessed through **Spring Data JPA** repositories.

---

##  Features

- RESTful API for CRUD operations
- Separate services and controllers for `User`, `Project`, and `Bug`
- Uses `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` relationships between entities
- Uses Spring Boot's dependency injection and auto-configuration
- Organized into `Controller`, `Service`, `Repository`, and `Domain` layers
