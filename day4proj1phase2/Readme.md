# User Registration Validation Console Application - Phase 2

##  Introduction

This is a Java-based console application that builds upon the `User Login Authentication` project. It simulates a basic user registration system with input validation and error logging functionality. The app allows dynamic user input and handles multiple user entries in a loop.

---

##  Description

The application prompts users to input a `username` and `age`. It validates the input using a custom `UserService`, ensuring users are at least 18 years old. If invalid input is detected (like underage users), the error is logged to a file called `error.log` with a timestamp.

This project demonstrates key Java concepts including input handling with `Scanner`, exception management, file I/O, and clean OOP design.

---

##  Objectives

- Accept dynamic user input (`username` and `age`)
- Allow repeated input until the user types `"exit"`
- Validate user age (must be 18 or older)
- Log exceptions to a file with timestamps
- Maintain clean and modular Java classes using Maven

---

##  Features

- Loop-based multi-user input
- Age validation logic
- Exception logging to `error.log`
- Timestamped error entries using `LocalDateTime`
- Simple and clean Java class design with Maven support
