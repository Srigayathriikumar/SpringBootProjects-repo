# Bug Tracker CLI Application

## Introduction

This project is a simple command-line Java application that demonstrates how to perform basic database operations using JDBC. The application allows users to add and retrieve bug reports stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Description

The application captures bug-related information such as title, description, and status from the user and stores it in a database. It then retrieves and displays all the stored bug records. This project showcases how Java can interact with a relational database using JDBC and applies a basic DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern to separate concerns.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate database connectivity using JDBC
- Perform basic CRUD operations (Create and Read)
- Apply object-oriented principles and modular structure
- Use PostgreSQL as a backend for Java applications

## Features

- Insert new bug records into the database
- Retrieve and display all bug records
- Structured using separate classes for model, DAO, and database utility
- Handles database exceptions gracefully

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- PostgreSQL
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse / VSCode (any)
