# Employee Tax System - Phase 1

## Description

This is a simple Java program demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism. It uses an abstract `Employee` class with two subclasses: `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee`. The program calculates and displays salary and tax details for each employee using a `List<Employee>`.

## Key Objectives

- Define an abstract `Employee` class with shared attributes and methods
- Create subclasses for full-time and part-time employees
- Calculate tax based on employee type
- Store all employees in a `List<Employee>`
- Use polymorphism to display details and tax

## Features

- Abstract base class: `Employee`
- Subclasses: `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`
- Tax calculation:
  - Full-time: 10% of salary
  - Part-time: 5% of salary
- Polymorphic `List<Employee>` to manage and display details
- Loop to print salary and tax for each employee

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code (optional)
